##Game Design 

- pay attention to game curses (design goals that are conflicting )

- i like looting 
- i like sneaking and outsmarting 
- i like a really cool story with plot twists and meaning (half life) 


i like portals ?

maybe you are a thief / looter in the underworld ?  steal from sarcophaguses? steal from the rich dead ? 
Slated Gold 

Entombed 

like CS:Go you use your riches to get better and better stuff. Can also use the stuff. 



First level is definitely going across the river styx -- blow people away.  Trains.
