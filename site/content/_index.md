<div class="intro">

Richter is a brand-new Quake engine, built from the ground up in
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Currently under active development, Richter aims
to accurately reproduce the original Quake feel while removing some of the
cruft that might prevent new players from enjoying a landmark experience.
